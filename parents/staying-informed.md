# Staying informed

Questions are great and we encourage parents to get involved, ask questions, and understand the program. We’ve seen that parents who understand the program are more likely to be able to support their Cadets as they face and overcome challenges.

We understand that you may have questions and that it can be frustrating sometimes feeling left out of communication flows. However, we encourage you to step back and let your Cadet do the work instead of you taking charge and spoon feeding them answers.

Not only does that build initiative on your Cadets’ part, it also gives our Staff Cadets (the role your child will eventually perform) opportunities to fulfill their leadership responsibilities.

Having said that, we know that most of our Cadets need a little extra support from their parents in their first year. We make it easy for parents to stay up to date via the following mechanisms.

### 540 Google account

Your Cadet has been assigned a 540 Google account. This account will be used as the primary source of all correspondence with your Cadet. Besides email, this account will also be used for Google Classroom, Google Calendar, and Google Meet.

We encourage you to remind your Cadet to check their account, and early in their journey sit with them to check it together. Note that we do not provide parents with access to these Google accounts as we want to encourage our Cadets to become responsible for their own path and advancement through the program.

### Closing parades

Each Tuesday training night ends with a closing parade where staff provide announcements to the Squadron. Attending provides an opportunity to hear the announcements in real-time and ensure your Cadet has understood and is adequately prepared. Representatives from our staff and SSC are also present at this time.

### **Website**

Announcements as well as information on upcoming events is posted to the website.&#x20;

We highly encourage you to add the 540 calendar (available on the website announcements page) to your own personal calendar so you will know what events are happening and where. Warning Orders (i.e. permission slips and information slip sheets) for events are also posted within relevant calendar events, as is the absence reporting form link.&#x20;

Note that the absence reporting link will only work for 540 Google accounts - please encourage and help your Cadet fill this form out as needed.

### **Slack**

Shortly after registering and providing your email address you will receive an email invite to our parents Slack group. This is an invite-only, closed group consisting of parents, SSC members, and Adult Staff. Questions are encouraged, but the answer might sometimes be “check with your Cadet first”. Parents are also encouraged to collaborate with other parents, for example to organize car pooling.
