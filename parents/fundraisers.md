# Fundraisers

**COVID-19 Update:** In-person fundraising may not be permitted.

The Squadron Sponsoring Committeeâ€™s main responsibility is to raise and administer funds to assist in the operation of the squadron. Most of the significant cost needed to run the squadron is provided through the fundraising efforts of the SSC. 

Our fundraising sub-committee is always looking for new and creative ways of approaching local government, businesses and service groups for financial assistance. We are open to hearing from you about any donation/sponsorship opportunities that you may know about. These can be money as well as goods or services donations \(e.g. food for various events, space for activities, gift baskets for raffles etc.\) Please contact [ssc.secretary@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:ssc.secretary@540goldenhawks.ca) for any questions.

The following are some of the specific activities we undertake to achieve our revenue goals.

## Tagging fundraiser

Twice a year the SSC runs a tagging fundraising event in the Oakville area. This is a mandatory activity for all Cadets and serves as our primary fundraiser. Cadets go out into the community over four days and solicit cash contributions from the public. This aims to raise awareness of the Air Cadet program as well as to engage community support.

## Lottery fundraiser

The Air Cadet League sponsors a lottery raffle every Spring for valuable cash prizes and new vehicles. The funds raised go directly towards the costs of operating the 60+ aircraft fleet used for Air Cadet glider training. All Cadet squadrons participate in ticket sales and as incentive, they receive back a portion of the funds they raise to help support specific squadron activities. Cadets are asked to sell lottery tickets from September to December to family, friends, neighbours etc. and the prize draw takes place during the following April.

## Meat fundraiser

At 540 squadron we have an annual meat fundraiser event in partnership with North Country, a reputable meat and seafood vendor with excellent quality products. The squadron receives a commission based on the number of boxes of meat and/or seafood sold. This is an effective and efficient way to raise funds while providing a great service to busy Cadet families. The money raised goes directly to supporting the squadron budget.
