# 2 - Financial Support to Cadets

## Background 

1. The Cadet Program advocates for inclusion and does not seek to prevent cadets from participating in the cadet program on the basis of the ability to pay a fee. As a result, financial assistance will be offered to Cadets in order to allow them to participate in the program.

## Identification of recipients

1. Parents / guardians will be made aware of the financial assistance program during registration.
2. Parents / guardians may apply for financial assistance by contacting the Commanding Officer by e-mail or in person.
3. The Commanding Officer has the discretion to request the waiving of fees based on the circumstances of each individual Cadet. Fees that can be waived include:
   1. Annual fees 
   2. Squadron trips e.g. March Break 
   3. Flying scholarship costs 
4. Criteria for acceptance are at the discretion of the CO in consultation with the Chairperson of the SSC   .
5. The SSC will approve the allocation of funds based on the recommendation of the Commanding Officer. 

## Funding the Program 

1. The SSC will ensure that funds are available to allow fees to be paid by Squadron funds on behalf of cadets requiring financial assistance. 
2. These funds will be segregated from the Squadron account \(separate line item\).
3. These funds will be sourced from:
   1. Donations with a specific request to support Cadets 
   2. A percentage of any surplus in the Squadron current account at the end of the training year
4. The total funds allocated to support Cadets will not exceed the total amount set aside for financial assistance in the training year. 
5. The  percentage of funds to be allocated to financial assistance will be agreed by the SSC as part of the annual budgeting process   .

## Maintaining dignity and privacy 

1. The name of the Cadet receiving the funds will be treated in confidence in order to maintain the dignity and privacy of Cadet families in need in line with the "Fund-raising at Cadet Corps and Squadrons" directive issued by Commander, National Cadet and Junior Canadian Rangers Support Group \(20 Feb 2019\).
2. Parents of Cadets receiving financial assistance will treat the financial assistance in confidence.
