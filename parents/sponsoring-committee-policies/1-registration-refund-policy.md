# 1 - Registration Refund Policy

1. The Cadet fee is refundable within the first month of the Cadet’s registration to the Program. Registered Cadets with more than 45 days past their registration date are not eligible for a refund.
2. In the event where in-person training is no longer possible and only virtual training is provided no refunds will be given.
3. In the event training cannot be offered as it was originally intended \(eg. cancelled, modified significantly\), the SSC will consider a credit \(in proportion to the Squadron’s savings and expenses by the end of the training year\) towards the next year’s registration for existing Cadets. The credit amount will be decided at an SSC meeting based on the Squadron's finances.
