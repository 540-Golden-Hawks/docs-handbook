# Supporting your Cadet's development

The training staff will instill in each new Recruit a sense of responsibility and ownership over their own “cadet careers” with us, however this takes time to build. We ask that parents support their first year Cadets’ development by encouraging them to participate and attend activities.

Being a Cadet takes hard work and effort, and your Cadet may find themselves struggling at times. As a parent, it is important that you help your Cadet persevere through any difficulties they may be having.

## Attendance

It is required for a Cadet to maintain a minimum 70% attendance for mandatory activities. Mandatory activities include Tuesday training nights and FTXs, and are necessary for a Cadet to pass their Proficiency Level as well as be eligible for promotion to the next rank. Other activities and teams such as the band and precision drill team have their own attendance commitments for Cadets who are selected to join those extra-curriculars.

In the event your Cadet cannot meet their attendance commitment for an activity, it is vital that they communicate this as soon as possible. We have a Report an Absence section on the website that facilitates this.

## Cadets & school

We understand that school is important to you and your Cadet, and that sometimes it will have to come before Cadets. That being said, participation in Cadet activities can provide your Cadet with many leadership and training opportunities not found in school. We encourage you to help your Cadet balance between their school and Cadet obligations.
