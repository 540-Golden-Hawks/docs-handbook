# Communication

540 Squadron relies on the following to facilitate communication within and without the Squadron.

## Closing Parade

At the end of each training night we have a Closing Parade. Parents are encouraged to come in and attend this to listen to announcements in real-time.

## Website

Announcements, Warning Orders \(i.e. permission slips\), and information on upcoming events are all posted to the website announcements page.

## Slack

There are two Slack workspaces used by 540 Squadron:

1. Staff workspace
2. Parent workspace

The Staff workspace has Adult Staff and Staff Cadets and is used to plan and coordinate training activities.

The parent workspace has parents and SSC members. This is an invite-only workspace and is used by the SSC to communicate parent-specific announcements. It is also a forum for parents to communicate with each other and ask questions.

## Google Classroom

Each training level has its own Google Classroom that all Cadets in that level are expected to join. These Classrooms are how level instructors communicate with their level.

## Social media

We encourage all Cadets and Parents to follow us on social media for updates on all our activities.
