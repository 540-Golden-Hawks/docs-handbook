# Paying of compliments

While attending any Squadron function, all personnel are to address each other by their rank and last name. This applies to any Squadron function, whether in uniform or not.

Except for below non-saluting zones, Cadets in uniform with headdress will acknowledge and salute all Commissioned Officers of the Canadian Armed Forces wherever and whenever they are recognized, whether the Officers are in uniform or not. This applies both in passing as well as when directly approaching an Officer

Cadets shall stand at attention when approaching a superior, (whether an Officer or a more senior cadet) and await to be acknowledged prior to engaging in conversation. In the case of approaching an Officer, a salute will be rendered.

## Non-saluting zones

Saluting will not be required in passing within the following designated non-saluting zones:

* School hallways
* School stairwells
* Canteen area

Salutes will always be rendered when directly approaching an Officer, even within a designated non-saluting zone.

Flight Commanders will salute Officers as they pass if they are marching with a flight (e.g. within school hallways).

## Classrooms

Cadets undergoing instruction (e.g. within a classroom, the gym, or elsewhere) are not to call the class to attention when observing the presence of a senior Cadet or Staff members. Discretion is given to the instructor to handle the interruption as they see fit depending on the circumstances.
