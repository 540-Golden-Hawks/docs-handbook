### Redress of grievance

Should a Cadet have a training related grievance, they must report it up the Chain of Command starting with their training staff, with escalations to the Level Warrant, Level Officer, or Training Officer as appropriate for the circumstances.

If a Cadet has a problem that they feel can not or should not be handled by a Cadet, they should bring it directly to an Officer.

If a Cadet feels they have been wrongly penalized they may submit their grievances in writing for review by the Commanding Officer. The request must be substantiated and thoroughly detailed. Once reviewed by the Commanding Officer, an interview will be conducted to determine if the appropriate action was taken. The decision of the Commanding Officer is final.
