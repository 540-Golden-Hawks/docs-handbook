# Uniform

Uniforms are temporarily issued to Cadets at no charge. Uniforms are provided and funded by the Department of National Defence. Cadets are responsible for the care, cleaning and custody of the uniform and also to return it when ceasing to be a Cadet.

The uniform includes:

1. A wedge cap
2. A beret
3. Rank slip-ons
4. Light blue short sleeved shirt
5. Necktie
6. Air Force blue jacket (also referred to as a “DEU tunic”)
7. Green jacket (also referred to as "FTU tunic")
8. Jacket belt
9. Air Force blue trousers
10. Green trousers
11. Boot blousers
12. Trouser belt
13. All-season jacket (also referred to as the "parka")
14. Ankle boots
15. Multipurpose boots
16. Grey wool socks
17. All applicable badges and accoutrements

All Cadets are to write their name within issued uniform parts (specifically the jackets) to help ensure they have the correct item when leaving a training activity. Name tags will be worn by cadets once issued.

A new Cadet is expected to attend training in appropriate civilian clothing as directed by their Level 1 / Recruit staff until they have been issued a uniform.
