# Wearing the uniform

Each Cadet is to ensure that they are in possession of all items of uniform, and that each item fits correctly. If not, they are to contact the SupO, through the chain of command, and arrange for items to be replaced. All uniforms remain the property of the Squadron, and are to be returned when the cadet leaves the unit.

## Headdress

**Wedge**: Worn on the right side of the head, centred front and back, with the front edge of the cap 2.5 cm \(1 in.\) above the right eyebrow. Two Air Force buttons must be attached in pre-cut holes at the front.

**Toque**: Worn as an alternative winter headdress. Toques shall be worn flush against the top of the head and turned up once to show either a 7.5 cm \(3 in.\) or a 10 cm \(4 in.\) fold according to the design of the toque, with the lower edge of the fold 2.5 cm \(1 in.\) above the eyebrows. The insignia is centered directly over the nose.

**Hijab**: A light blue hijab may be used by female Muslim cadets underneath the applicable headdress.

## Jacket \("tunic"\)

Sleeves shall be roll-pressed with no creases. Jackets shall be worn fully buttoned-up with the exception of the top button.

**Jacket belts**: Worn so that the excess of the belt, once attached, is on the left side of the buckle. The buckle shall be adjusted so that it is centred on the buttons of the jacket.

**Badges and insignia**: Sewn on the uniform neatly using a thread that blends with the badge and uniform. Badges shall not be glued.

## Trousers

**Belt for trousers**: The issued narrow black web belt with brass buckle shall be worn with the trousers. Belts should be worn so the excess belt protrudes from the buckle toward the wearer’s left. Buckles with elemental / sqn / CTC badges are authorized for wear with the uniform.

## Blue collared shirt

Worn with tie with or without jacket or open neck without jacket. Rank slip-ons shall be worn with the shirt.
