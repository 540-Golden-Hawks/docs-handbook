# Maintaining the uniform

It costs the Department of National Defence hundreds of dollars to outfit each cadet. The squadron has a fixed budget to purchase uniforms each year. It is critical that the cadet takes care of their uniform, keeps it cleaned and pressed, and returns it to the squadron when they leave the squadron or outgrow the uniform.

The following tips will be useful to cadets in keeping their uniform to standard.

## Washing

* The uniform shirt can be machine-washed in warm water \(not hot\). Scrub the collar and under-arm area with a brush and some kind of pre-wash liquid prior to washing. Shoulder rank slipons must be removed before washing as they will be damaged by normal washing.  
* The jacket, trousers and socks should be machine-washed in cold water otherwise the colour may run.  

## Dry cleaning

* The wedge, tie and shoulder rank slip-ons must be dry-cleaned.  

## Ironing

* Be sure not to use too hot an iron or the fabric will be scorched. The new fabric uniforms will actually melt. Use an ironing cloth or dish towel to avoid the iron actually touching the fabric.
* Ties and slip-ons \(epaulettes\) should be ironed.  
* Do not iron creases into sleeves of jacket.  

## Alterations to uniform

* You must not make any modification to your uniform items.  
* At times the length of the trouser legs need to be taken up \(the bottom of the trouser leg should be in line with the third lace hole from the bottom of your boots\). Hem by hand with a loose stitch. You must not cut the material of your trousers to shorten them.  
* You must not cut the belt to make it shorter.

## Badges

* Badges must be sewn on by hand or machine stitched with a long stitch. If tiny stitches are used it is difficult to remove badges and marks are left on the fabric. Do not use glue or two-way iron on tape. 
* Take care when removing badges so as to avoid unnecessary damage to uniforms.

## Boots

* You should polish your boots with a Kiwi cloth and black polish. 

## All Season Coat \("parka"\)

* The All Season Coat \("parka"\) has a removable fleece liner. Note that the liner is never to be worn on its own when the jacket is worn. 
* It is important that the liner is not lost.
* Put your name in both the inner fleece and outer shell.
