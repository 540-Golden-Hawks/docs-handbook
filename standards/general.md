# General

The standards contained within this section are to be treated directly as orders from the Chain of Command. All personnel shall acquaint themselves with, obey, and enforce these orders. Breaches will be dealt with accordingly and ignorance of the contents of these orders will not be accepted as an excuse for failure to obey them.

Personnel are expected to interpret these orders intelligently, bearing in mind that no order can provide for every situation or emergency or replace sound judgment and efficient supervision. Personnel are expected to use their common sense in unusual or emergency situations.

Suggested modifications to the standards and orders contained within can be made in writing up the Chain of Command for review by the Training Officer.
