C1 is the most formal order of dress and is comprised of:

* Jacket with medals
* Collared shirt with tie
* Accoutrements
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2 - Mess" %}
C2 is worn for mess dinners and banquets and has the following changes from C1 Ceremonial dress:

* No headdress
* No name tag
* Jacket with ribbons \(no medals\)
* Black bow tie instead of black tie
* White dress shirt

It is important to note that no headdress is worn in C2 both in transit or at an event. Cadets are to leave their headdress at home when wearing C2.

If a Cadet doesn't have a black bow tie and a white dress shirt, an alternative is to wear the issued blue collared shirt and black  necktie. There is no mixing of the two, the bow tie is only worn with a white shirt and the necktie is only worn with the blue shirt.
