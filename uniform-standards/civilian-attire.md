# Civilian attire

Cadets wearing civilian clothes during cadet activities shall dress and conduct themselves in a manner that reflects positively as members of the Cadet Program.

The expectation on a uniformed training night is that cadets in civilian attire wear an equivalent standard of dress consisting of at a minimum a white dress shirt, black trousers, and black formal shoes.

Civilian and uniform clothing items shall not be worn together. Exceptions to this are when in transit to/from a cadet activity \(i.e. use of winter overcoat or rain jacket on top of uniform\) or where specifically authorized by the Chain of Command.

Civilian attire must at all times be appropriate and not bring discredit to the Cadet Program. The following is a non-exhaustive list of unacceptable clothing items.

* Torn or ripped clothing \(e.g. distressed jeans\)
* Clothing that exposes shoulders, midriffs, or legs \(e.g. tank tops, muscle shirts, crop tops, short shorts, etc.\)

If there are any questions as to whether something is acceptable or not, please ask your parents, and then ask the Chain of Command.
