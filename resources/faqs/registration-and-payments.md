# Registration fee payment

For any further questions about the registration fee payment, please contact a member of the SSC.

## How much is the registration fee and what does it include?

Registration is $250 per cadet. The registration fee alone does not cover the total cost for all of the activities provided by the squadron. The registration fee goes towards the total cost of the program along with grants from DND as well as fundraising and sponsorship. Program costs include: payments to the Air Cadet League of Canada, facility rentals, as well as operational and training costs incurred by the squadron.

## Are there any other expenses throughout the year?&#x20;

There should be no other mandatory additional costs except an approximate $10 ticket for the annual banquet if there is one. There are some optional costs in a normal year - for example, the March Break Trip and spirit wear.

## What is the refund policy?&#x20;

Refunds will be given up to 45 days after training starts per our [Registration Refund Policy](../../parents/sponsoring-committee-policies/1-registration-refund-policy.md).

## What if I cannot afford the registration fee?

The cadet program advocates for inclusion and does not seek to prevent cadets from participating in the cadet program on the basis of the ability to pay a fee. As a result, financial assistance will be offered to cadets in order to allow them to participate in the program. No cadet will be excluded from the program due to financial hardship.&#x20;

For more information refer to our [Financial Support to Cadets ](../../parents/sponsoring-committee-policies/2-financial-support-to-cadets.md)policy or [contact the Commanding Officer ](mailto:co@540goldenhawks.ca)to discuss your options.

## Is there a discount for registering multiple siblings?

Yes, each additional sibling is $200, saving $50.

## Is there a cost for the uniform?

There is no cost for obtaining a uniform. Uniforms are paid for and provided by DND. An initial set is provided when a new cadet joins the squadron and we permit exchanges and replacements to accommodate for physical growth over the cadetâ€™s time with the squadron. Uniforms are the property of DND and are expected to be returned when the cadet leaves the squadron.

## How do I pay the registration fee?

The registration fee is collected online. There is no option for in person payment. Returning cadets are emailed the registration payment link through their 540 email account. New recruits will receive the link after the Recruit Registration event.
