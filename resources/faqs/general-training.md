## Cadet program

### What is the Cadet Program all about?

The Cadet Program is the premiere youth program in Canada. It includes the Royal Canadian Sea, Army and Air Cadets. It is a national program for young Canadians aged 12 to 18 who are interested in participating in a variety of fun, challenging and rewarding activities while learning about the sea, army and air activities of the Canadian Forces.

Cadets are encouraged to become active, responsible members of their communities. They make valuable contributions to Canadian society on a daily basis in terms of environmental, citizenship and community activities. Cadets also learn valuable life and work skills such as teamwork, leadership and citizenship.

Coached and supervised by Officers of the Canadian Forces, Cadets progress through stages of increasing responsibilities and leadership, with senior Cadets organizing and taking a lead role in many of the activities.

Cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces, nor are they expected to join the military.

### **How is Air Cadets different from Army or Sea Cadets?**

Our recruiting staff are quick to point out that the Earth’s surface is composed of approximately 1/3 land and 2/3 water, but the entire Earth’s surface has air. That may be a slightly biased response, so interpret that as you wish.

The Air, Army, and Sea programs share many common goals such as the development of young Canadians into future leaders that have the skills to be successful in society. All three programs have similar rank and progression structures, similar opportunities for leadership and teamwork, as well as a similar core training program. Where the programs differ is the elemental academic training content as well as the selection of extra-curricular activities above the core training program.

What the Air elemental academic training provides is a focus on aviation, aerospace, principles of flight, propulsion, meteorology, etc.

Extra-curricular activities include the opportunity for all Cadets to experience glider familiarization flights, aviation themed trips, as well as the opportunity to attend Ground School to compete for an opportunity to receive a Glider Pilot License and/or Power Pilot License.

### As a parent of a Cadet, who do I ask my questions to?

Questions are great and we encourage parents to get involved, ask questions, and understand the program. We’ve seen that parents who understand the program are more likely to be able to support their Cadets as they face and overcome challenges.

It is standard operating procedure for Air Cadet units to operate with a clearly defined chain of command. This is beneficial because the Commanding Officer – being only one person – can not realistically meet with each Cadet or parent individually. In order to fully meet the needs of the Cadets and their parents, we adhere to our Chain of Command.

The Chain of Command is the command hierarchy within our unit starting at the top with our CO, proceeding down to section heads, junior staff, and then down through our Staff Cadets and ultimately ending at the bottom with our brand new recruits.

## Chain of Command

### **How should Cadets use the Chain of Command?**

All of our Cadets learn about the chain of command – right from Day \#1 in recruit training – and we encourage all of our Cadets to follow that chain of command when asking questions or speaking to staff. This means that Cadets should contact a peer or their Staff Cadets to their before jumping straight to an Adult Staff member. This gives your Cadet the chance to go through the process of problem-solving as well as practising communication skills and taking initiative.

The Cadet they ask will either answer the question, or continue the process up the Chain of Command until an answer is found, and brought back down the chain.

### **How should parents support the Chain of Command?**

We understand that you may have questions and that it can be frustrating sometimes feeling left out of communication flows. However, we encourage you to step back and let your Cadet do the work instead of you taking charge and spoon feeding them answers.

Not only does that build initiative on your Cadets’ part, it also gives our Staff Cadets \(the role your child will eventually perform\) opportunities to fulfill their leadership responsibilities.

Having said that, we know that most of our Cadets need a little extra support from their parents in their first year. We make it easy for parents to stay up to date in the same way as our Cadets – our website. All announcements, sign up forms, administrative issues are all posted online for you and your Cadet to read together.

We also have a dedicated Slack workspace for parents, Adult Staff, and SSC members to communicate on.

In addition, 1st year parents are strongly encouraged to come into the Blakelock gym for closing parades on Tuesday evenings to listen to the announcements.

### **When can we bypass the Chain of Command**

There are occasions when it is necessary to bypass the Chain of Command, e.g. due to time constraints, safety issues, sensitive issues not appropriate for youth to deal with, or other reasons. In these situations it is appropriate and encouraged for Cadets or parents to directly contact an Adult Staff member or directly contact the CO.

All our Adult Staff members have an open door policy. In fact, the staff office sits in the main school hallway – so there are no doors.

### **Does this mean Cadets/parents should not interact with staff members?**

Absolutely not!

While the Adult Staff are here to help facilitate the program via our Staff Cadets, they pride themselves on their ability to connect with and mentor all of the youth under their care.

Parents are always encouraged to come in and say hello.

## Adult staff

### **Who are the staff?**

The adult staff are made up of a combination of the following:

* Officers and Non-Commissioned Members \(NCMs\) of the Canadian Armed Forces
* Civilian Instructors hired as specialists by the Department of National Defence
* Civilian Volunteers screened by the Air Cadet League of Canada

‌Our Officers are within the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service \(COATS\) sub-component of the Reserve Force. They are specifically trained and tasked with the supervision, administration, and training of our Cadets.

As a member of the Reserves, all of our Officers have full time day jobs, or are pursuing post-secondary education, and dedicate their evenings, weekends, and even vacation days to the development of the youth under our care.

Our Adult Staff come from all walks of life and bring a wealth of knowledge and personal experience to the Squadron. The vast majority of our Adult Staff were Air Cadets before and all of them are here to give back to the community and the program that raised them.

### **Do the adult staff work full time at 540 Sqn?**

All of our adult staff either have full time day jobs or are post-secondary students. They dedicate and volunteer their evenings, weekends, and sometimes vacation days to the development of the youth of 540 Sqn.
