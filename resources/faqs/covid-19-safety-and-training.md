# COVID-19 safety and training

## What is your COVID-19 safety protocol?

The safety of the cadets and staff is our greatest concern and is taken seriously by the staff and volunteers at 540. Our safety protocols will be approved by DND and shared prior to resumption of in-person training. They will be continuously revised and updated based on guidance from public health authorities and are expected to include an element of social distancing and masking.

## Will vaccinations be required to participate? 

At the moment, there is no mandatory requirement for cadets to be vaccinated to participate in the program. In preparation for in-person training, the staff are asking that a voluntary vaccine self-declaration be completed. The link has been sent to existing cadets via their 540 email address. \*Please note that vaccines and self-declaration are not mandatory for participation in cadet activities at this time, and all responses to this form will be kept confidential to squadron staff.

## Is there a virtual option if my cadet cannot attend in-person training activities?  

Our focus and priority is on safely resuming in-person activities. If we are unable to do so we will continue to offer a virtual training program.

## Will there be a limit on the number of new cadets who can register if training is in-person this year? 

Given the current limitations, yes. Potential new cadets who attend the recruit registration will be given the opportunity to register first. Any recruits who do not register in September will remain on the waiting list and will be offered an opportunity to join at our next recruiting drive.

## What are the training nights for each level?  

Pre-COVID, our in-person training nights were on Tuesdays and we are hoping to keep that as our training night. We are in the process of obtaining the necessary approvals from all stakeholders to conduct in-person training and will communicate more information once we have it.
