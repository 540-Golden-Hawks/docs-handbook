# COVID-19 safety and training

This page summarizes various COVID-19 and training related questions asked at the beginning of this 2021-2022 training year.&#x20;

Please also refer to the [slideshow presentation ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kCWd87-5Q2bnNwLS1OCWLX4Z93kmhb8a/view?usp=sharing)provided during the Returning Cadet Information Night on 21 Sep 21.

If you have any further questions, please [review the FAQs contained within this handbook](./), or use our [Q\&A Google Form ](https://forms.gle/eETkeAkr84WaVkf86)to submit your question and we will get back to you. If it is urgent, please email [info@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:info@540goldenhawks.ca) directly and include the name of your cadet in your email. Note that we have a high volume of emails and it may take a few days to get back to you.

## Training

### Is there a virtual option if my cadet cannot attend in-person training activities? &#x20;

Our focus and priority is on safely resuming in-person activities. Only if we are unable to do so will we offer a virtual training program.

### What are the training nights for each level? &#x20;

The current plan is for Levels 1 & 3 to train on Tuesdays and Levels 2 & 4 to train on Wednesdays. Level 5 will support their corresponding level.

### In the second half of the training year, is there a possibility of having all levels on the same training night?

We endeavour to have all cadets on one training night for the week (on Tuesdays). This will be revisited in December to determine if facilities/distancing limitations permit this. A decision will be communicated before January 2022.

### When does in-person training start?

Our tentative start date is 5/6 October. Should our in-person training request not yet be approved by Friday, 1 October, our in-person training start-date will be rescheduled back a week to 12/13 October.

### What Level am I in?

If you attended virtual training last year and participated regularly, you will start this year in the following level (Example: If I was in Level 2 last year and participated regularly (75% Attendance) I will start this year in Level 3.

If last year you requested a leave of absence and did not participate in the virtual training that was offered, you were not automatically advanced to the following level and will return to training at the same level that was left off.

### It’s really disappointing to hear that returning cadets will not be allowed to advance to the next level of training unless they participated virtually last training year. Will you be reconsidering this aspect in any way?

Level 3 and Level 4 have leadership components that are essential to progressing to the next level. We want to ensure that all cadets are set up for success and ensure they have the same knowledge as the other cadets. Please reach out to the Training Officer, Lt Anthony Vukojevic ([avukojevic@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:avukojevic@540goldenhawks.ca)), should you have any additional questions on this decision.&#x20;

### I can’t attend training on my assigned Level training night. Can I go another day?

Cadet training for specific levels will take place on the dates mentioned in the presentation — Tuesdays for levels 1 and 3; Wednesdays for levels 2 and 4. If you are unable to attend the designated training night, please reach out to Squadron Staff to learn where you could find a local cadet program that can accommodate your schedule.

### When will we receive schedules and timings?

Training nights for your specific level have been identified in the presentation to aid cadet families with planning and scheduling. Specific times will be posted shortly to the squadron calendar/website. Please keep a close eye on the 540 Training google calendar for start and end times.&#x20;

You can view this calendar on our website ([https://540goldenhawks.ca/training/announcements/](https://540goldenhawks.ca/training/announcements/)), or add it to your personal devices [with this link.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2/r?cid=540goldenhawks.com\_i6gpdb2l58nik3ivniu9o9p5jg@group.calendar.google.com\&cid=canadian\_\_en@holiday.calendar.google.com)

### How do we access the Google Classroom?

The Level Google Classrooms invite link will be sent to your 540 email addresses prior to the start of in-person training. Please send an email to [it@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:it@540goldenhawks.ca?subject=\[Lastname],%20\[Firstname]%20-%20No%20Google%20Classroom%20access\&body=PLEASE%20PUT%20YOUR%20NAME%20IN%20THE%20SUBJECT%20LINE) with subject “\[Lastname], \[Firstname] - No Google Classroom access” if you still don’t have access to your Google Classroom by 1 October.

### Would we be considered returning if we did not attend training last year but attended previous years?

Yes! Welcome back.&#x20;

### What do we wear on our first day of in-person training?

You will be wearing your brand new issued FTUs. If you have not received your FTUs yet, please reach out to your training staff to coordinate a time to pick up your new uniform. You should have already filled out the [uniform measurement form](https://forms.gle/QcM8DKbux3roQo9U9).

If you do not have FTUs by the first night, or they do not fit, you will wear your blue 540 cadet shirt, tucked into black pants with dark running shoes. If you do not yet have a blue 540 cadet shirt, please contact your chain of command on what to wear.

### Will there be drill competitions this year? When will we get more information regarding drill teams?

There has not yet been confirmation from leadership on if there will be any drill competitions for this year — physical distancing remains an important consideration. Information regarding drill team activities will be shared near the end of October.

### Can you clarify the requirements for attending and registering for Ground School?

In order to be eligible for Ground School, cadets must:

1. Be entering Level 3 training or higher&#x20;
2. Be 15 years old as of 31 August 2021

Registration for the 2021/22 Ground School cycle has been completed, with the first class having taken place on 25 Sep 21. Weekly classes will take place in order to support Glider Pilot Training Course (GPTC) and Power Pilot Training Course (PPTC) applicants participating in the new Mandatory Ground School Course offered by the Moncton Flight College in conjunction with PAL Aerospace.&#x20;

Cadets participating in 540’s Ground School program alongside the new Mandatory Ground School Course will write an Entrance Exam in January 2022 and, if successful, will complete a National Course Interview. If successful, they will attend the GPTC or PPTC during the summer of 2022.&#x20;

Further questions may be directed to Lt Taieb at [groundschool@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:groundschool@540goldenhawks.ca).&#x20;

### Will there be a limit on the number of new cadets who can register if training is in-person this year?&#x20;

Given the current limitations, yes. Potential new cadets who attended the recruit registration will be given the opportunity to register first. Any recruits who do not register in September will remain on the waiting list and will be offered an opportunity to join at our next recruiting drive.

## COVID-19 Safety

### What is your COVID-19 safety protocol?

The safety of the cadets and staff is our greatest concern and is taken seriously by the staff and volunteers at 540. Our safety protocols will be approved by DND and shared prior to resumption of in-person training. They will be continuously revised and updated based on guidance from public health authorities and are expected to include an element of social distancing and masking.

### Will cadets be required to show proof of vaccination?

As of this time, requirements for vaccinations (and proof thereof) are specific to the facilities that 540 Squadron will use. The primary training location as of 22 Sep 21 DOES require that the space renting group (540 Squadron) be able to provide evidence of vaccination from all visitors.

### Is Blakelock requiring vaccinations at this time?

As of 22 September, the Town of Oakville has notified Recreational School Permit Holders (including 540 Golden Hawks Air Cadets) of a requirement to ensure that visitors to school facilities have provided evidence of full vaccination or exemption status.&#x20;

Please see related announcements from:

1. [Our Commanding Officer (Maj DePass)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybKTVx0dgdn1wEkyDN2TO3tJFGDLjrRh/view?usp=sharing);
2. [The Commanding Officer of the Cadet Program in Ontario (LCol O'Leary)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/169dKPG9g5XPuB3uuzAYjilcFI6BEGeYY/view?usp=sharing); and
3. [The Town of Oakville](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yzFBSD0vJNUQcV3mk-xr0SSATc8\_s8WZ/view?usp=sharing).

If you / your cadet is unable to provide this confirmation before our first training night, you are urged to communicate in confidence to the Commanding Officer - [co@540goldenhawks.ca](mailto:co@540goldenhawks.ca)

### Do you have an approximate idea of the number of cadets attending in-person for each level? How will cohorts be split?

Cohort size for level training as of this time for weekly training  are currently estimated at 35. It is important to note that the space to be used for training will facilitate physical distancing at all times. This will be enforced and supervised by staff. Cohorts will be designated one training space for the evening.

## Supply

### Where can we get boot paste for FTUs?

Squadron staff will look to see if we can stock these in supply and sell them at cost to cadets.

### I picked up the FTUs but don’t have blues. How do I get those? How do I change my boots if they are too big?

Please submit your [Uniform Measurement form](https://forms.gle/QcM8DKbux3roQo9U9) and enter details on what uniform parts are missing/too big/too small so they can be prepared by our supply team. There is a section under “DEU” asking cadets “What blues do you need?”

### I did the FTU sizing form but I didn’t get an email for pick-up confirmation. What should I do?

If you have submitted your [Uniform Measurement form](https://forms.gle/QcM8DKbux3roQo9U9) you will be contacted on when  to attend St. Paul’s for uniform pickup.

### Are the forms for the FTU and the blue uniform the same?

There is one [Uniform Measurement form ](https://forms.gle/QcM8DKbux3roQo9U9)for FTUs and DEUs (“blues”). Please enter details on what uniform parts are missing so they can be prepared by our supply team. There is a section under “DEU” asking cadets “What blues do you need?”

### On the Uniform Measurement form it says forehead circumference if you require a wedge headdress. What does it mean?

Circumference of the head is measured above the eyebrows. It is used to determine the size of wedge (headdress) required. If you already have one that fits, you do not need to fill out this section.

### How do we exchange uniform pieces that don’t fit anymore?

Until the first training night, uniform exchanges can be done by filling out the [Uniform Measurement form](https://forms.gle/QcM8DKbux3roQo9U9) and indicating what uniform parts are required. If you have already completed the form, you will be contacted to attend St. Paul's once your uniform is ready for pickup.

Once in-person training begins, uniform exchange will take place at T.A. Blakelock.&#x20;

## Administration

### I didn’t get any of the forms/calendars in my 540 account. What should I do?
