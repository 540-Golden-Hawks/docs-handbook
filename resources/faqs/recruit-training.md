# Recruit training

## **What happens on the first night?**

Once our administration department has processed the recruit paperwork, training can begin training.  
On the first few regular training nights a new recruit will go through initial training, consisting of:

* Procedures for communicating with superiors
* Basics of marching
* Personal deportment

The transition from civilian to cadet can be intimidating, and your recruit will need your support and encouragement throughout the training process.

## **When will the uniform arrive?**

It typically takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks from the date of measurement for uniforms to arrive. Once the uniform arrives, your cadet will be taught how to properly wear and maintain their uniform.  
In the meantime, they should be wearing appropriate civilian attire as dictated by their recruit staff.

## **What teams can Recruits join?**

A new Recruit is eligible to join any of our teams during their intake periods, usually in September. Most teams go through a “tryout” selection process and require multiple weeks of attendance before final decisions can be made.

Selection is not always solely based on immediate skill; motivation, learning ability, maturity, and other factors are also taken into consideration, so your cadet shouldn’t feel discouraged just because they’re new!

If your cadet does not make a team it is recommended that they try out for another open team – previous team status is not a factor.

## What is an FTX

A Field Training Exercise \(FTX\) is an overnight 3 day, 2 night training weekend where cadets learn a significant portion of their mandatory training. The daytime consists of training and activities, and in the afternoons the cadets get time off to socialize with peers before resting for the next day of training.  
Training topics covered for first year cadets on an FTX include:

* Survival psychology
* Fire building
* Snare building
* Shelter building
* Radio navigation
* Fitness

The Fall FTX occurs near the start of the training year and is a mandatory training activity. It is required that all cadets attend the Fall FTX in order to pass their training level.  
In addition to the Fall FTX, there is also a Spring and Summer FTX. These FTXs are complementary and are not mandatory events. It is strongly encouraged for all cadets, especially 1st year cadets, to attend all FTXs.

## **What is tagging?**

The tagging fundraiser \(“tagging”\) occurs twice a year and is the squadron’s primary source of fundraising. Money raised through tagging is used to pay for school rentals, transportation, training equipment, supplies, etc.  
One session is held in the fall at the beginning of the training year and a second session is held in the spring. Each tagging weekend runs from Thursday to Sunday and includes 6 shifts that the cadets can sign up for and participate in. Each shift is approximately 4-5 hours. While on a shift, cadets will be assigned a retail location in Oakville. New/junior cadets are paired with senior cadets at each location.  
Cadets are expected to participate in at least 3 tagging shifts in the fall and 3 more tagging shifts in the spring.
