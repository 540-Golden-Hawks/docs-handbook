# Summer training

## **What is Summer Training?**

Summer Training, also erroneously known as “summer camp” is conducted at one of many Cadet Training Centre \(CTC\) across Ontario and Canada. Summer Training provides Cadets with in depth and specialized knowledge to supplement their regular training. Courses run during July and August, and range from 2 to 7 weeks long. Some of the topics offered include aviation, leadership, fitness, marksmanship, survival, music, and more.

## **Application process**

### **What is the application process?**

Being selected to attend Summer Training is a competitive process and Cadets are required to apply and go through a selection process that is based on several factors such as their attendance records, participation in squadron activities, and performance within the Squadron. Advanced courses such as the Glider and Power Pilot Training Courses and International Air Cadet Exchange Courses require a more extensive application process including an interview with a selection committee comprised of members of the Air Cadet League of Canada and the Department of National Defence.

### **Does every cadet get to go to Summer Training?**

Approximately 20,000 cadets across Canada are selected to attend summer training. As such, cadets are required to apply and go through a selection process that is based on several factors such as their attendance records, participation in squadron activities, and performance within the squadron. National courses such as the Glider and Power Pilot Training Courses and International Exchange require a more extensive application process and include an interview.

### **Can we request a specific course serial?**

Unfortunately, logistics and scheduling of summer courses is performed at the provincial and national level and are largely out of the control of 540 Sqn. The cadet units in our local area are typically assigned to Serial A for three week courses and Serial B for the two week General Training course.

Cadets who request other serials will be offered a position only if there are not enough cadets from the units typically assigned to that serial. As there is a lot of competition for summer training positions, cadets being accepted to other serials is very rare.

## **Training centre**

### **Where do Cadets live? What do they eat?**

Living arrangements vary between training centres, and may include barracks, student residences, or semi-permanent softwall shelters. Cadets will share a sleeping space with peers, separated by gender.

All meals will be provided by the training centre, and will be served in the mess hall or equivalent dining facility. Cadets may also have an opportunity to eat MREs \(Meals Ready to Eat\). Snacks and drinks can be purchased from the canteen during their free time.

### **Can I visit my Cadet?**

Training occurs six days a week from before breakfast to after dinner, and as such parents are encouraged to visit their cadets only during evenings or weekends.

Depending on the course, parents may pick up cadets for weekend leave after training has concluded for the week. Cadets attending the first year, 2-week General Training Course are not eligible for leave.

### **How do I contact my Cadet?**

Cell phones are not permitted during training hours, and can only be used during free time \(evenings and weekends\). Cadets will have access to pay phones during their stay at a CSTC, and can purchase calling cards from the canteen or bring them from home. You may also write mail to your cadet, to the address found in the joining instructions for your cadet’s CSTC. In the event of an emergency, please contact the Duty Centre for your cadet’s CSTC, found in the joining instructions.

### **Who are the staff?**

Similar to the home unit, the summer training centres employ the same ‘youth leading youth’ model with most of the instruction and close supervision performed by staff cadets with facilitation and overall supervision by CIC Officers and Civilian Instructors.

### **What does my Cadet have to bring with them?**

Each training centre has different requirements. A detailed kit list will be provided in the summer course joining instructions once your cadet has been accepted to summer training.

## **What if I have more questions?**

The Squadron staff will be happy to answer your questions. However we ask that you review the CTC brochures and joining instructions prior to reaching out.
