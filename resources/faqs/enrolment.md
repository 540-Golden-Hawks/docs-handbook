# Enrolment

## What are the eligibility requirements?

To be eligible for membership as a Cadet the recruit must:

* Between the ages of 12 and 18
* A legal resident of Canada
* Have proof of health insurance
* Be medically, physically and psychologically fit to join Cadets and participate in related training and/or activities
* Be of good morale character
* Not belong to another corps or squadron
* Be acceptable to the Commanding Officer \(CO\)

## When can we join?

We take on new Recruits each September, followed by a second intake normally in November or January

Due to the high demand for the program we run very specific recruit intake windows. Look for more information on the website over the summer to find out more.

## What time commitment do Cadets need to make?

On a weekly basis, Cadets are required to attend a training night from 1830 - 2130 hrs.

In addition to the training night there are occasional weekend activities such as our weekend field training exercises \(FTXs\), Remembrance Day Parades, or fundraising events organized by our Squadron Sponsoring Committee \(SSC\).

## What activities take place outside of mandatory training nights?

We offer a number of extracurricular activities, teams, and events that Cadets are not required to attend, but are highly encouraged to so in order to maximize the value the Cadet Program can provide.

## We donâ€™t live in Oakville, can my child still join?

Due to the distance and logistical stress involved with transporting Cadets to training, we recommend that families outside of Oakville join us a similar Air Cadet unit in their town. 

The cities of Burlington, Milton, and Mississauga all have thriving Air Cadet units that run excellent programs.

## My child requires accommodations, can they still join Air Cadets?

The Cadet Program is an all inclusive and accommodating program.

We encourage you to speak to our recruiting staff in person on a Tuesday training night or email us with any questions.
