# Cadet jargon

### CO's Parade

Commanding Officer’s Parades are performed on the first Tuesday of every month. They are an opportunity for the CO to inspect each Cadet and the Squadron as a whole. All Cadets are expected to attend these evenings and to look as sharp as possible. 

### Flag party

The Cadet Flag Party is symbolic of a military Colour Party or Colour Guard and serves a similar function. By carrying the Squadron Banner on parade they represent the entire Squadron and are treated with the utmost respect. As a sign of respect and reverence all members of the parade stand at attention when the Flag Party is marched on or off the parade. Similarly, spectators are asked to stand for the duration of the event.

### Parade square

The Cadets form up on the parade square to open and close each training night. 

The Squadron Warrant Officer, or designate, is in command of the entire Squadron and stands at the front and centre of the parade square. On a typical training night the Squadron is formed up in four columns, representing the four training levels, with Level Warrant Officers in front of each level and each level’s Staff Cadet dispersed throughout their level. From the perspective of the members on parade, Level 1 is on the left and Level 4 is on the right.

Other groups on the parade square will include a Flag Party, Guard, and a band.
