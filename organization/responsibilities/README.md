# Responsibilities

All cadets are assigned a rank regardless of appointment.

Rank is assigned based on promotion guidelines outlined within this document and correlate to proficiency within the training program. Appointments on the other hand, are specific job assignments assigned to designated personnel by, or on behalf of, the CO. An appointment can be permanent or temporary. Appointments can also be altered or rescinded at the CO’s discretion at any time.

Appointments to a position are based on, but not limited to, performance, attendance, attitude, experience, rank, and seniority.

Each appointment carries with it specific duties and responsibilities that the appointee must perform. Appointments and duties may be assigned as ‘primary’ or ‘secondary’.
