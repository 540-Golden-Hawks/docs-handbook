# Our Squadron



## Cadets

Our 250+ Cadets start their journey with us through practical, hands on training that builds interest, experience, and skill. As they progress through the years, the training program transitions to a more academic and rigorous program that will prepare them for taking on the role of a Staff Cadet at 540 Squadron.

## Staff Cadets

As our Cadets progress through the program they transition from receiving the training to providing the training program. Once they reach Level 5 \(their fifth year of training\), they are appointed to the role of Staff Cadet and assigned various leadership positions within the squadron.

Our 16-18 year old Staff Cadets are empowered to take on the responsibility of running the day to day operations of the Squadron including instruction, evaluation, planning of activities, and supervision of all junior Cadets.

Based on a rigorous interview and evaluation process, a small portion of our Staff Cadets are promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer where they are placed into a managerial role and tasked with supervising, developing, and leading their fellow Staff Cadets.

## Adult staff

While Staff Cadets are empowered to take on the responsibility of running the Squadron, ultimately it is the Adult Staff that are accountable to ensure the safe, fun, and valuable delivery of the Cadet Program. The adult staff are made up of a combination of the following:

* Officers and Non-Commissioned Members of the Canadian Armed Forces
* Civilian Instructors hired as specialists by the Department of National Defence
* Civilian Volunteers screened by the Air Cadet League of Canada

Our Officers are within the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service \(COATS\) sub-component of the Reserve Force. They are specifically trained and tasked with the supervision, administration, and training of our Cadets.

As a member of the Reserves, all of our Officers have full time day jobs, or are pursuing post-secondary education, and dedicate their evenings, weekends, and even vacation days to the development of the youth under our care.

Our Adult Staff come from all walks of life and bring a wealth of knowledge and personal experience to the Squadron. The vast majority of our Adult Staff were Air Cadets before and are here to give back to the community and the program that they themselves benefited from.

## Squadron Sponsoring Committee \(SSC\)

The SSC is an integral partner to the success of our Squadron. They work to ensure annual plans are in place, fundraising is organized, finances are managed, volunteers are trained, and donors are recognized.

The SSC is made up of a four person Executive in the roles of Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary. Supporting the Executive, are approximately 10 Committee Members. The SSC Chair has regular interactions with the Commanding Officer of the Squadron and both partners work collaboratively to provide a broad range of programs and experiences to the Cadets of 540 Squadron.

Some facets of the training program the SSC are responsible for include:

* Providing suitable accommodation and resources for Cadet training and activities
* Management of Squadron funds
* Fundraising for activities over and above those already supported by the Department of National Defence
