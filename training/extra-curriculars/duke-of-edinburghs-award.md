# Duke of Edinburgh's Award

The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award program is a non-competitive program that operates in more than 130 countries and territories. It is not part of the Cadet Program, but is offered by our Squadron Staff as an extracurricular due to the ease in which Cadets can achieve much of the Award simply by participating in Squadron activities.

The Award was founded by His Royal Highness, Prince Philip to encourage personal development and community involvement for young people between the ages of 14 and 25 through four distinct areas:

1. Community Service
2. Skill Development
3. Physical Fitness
4. Adventurous Journey

Since its establishment in Canada in 1963, more than 500,000 young Canadians have taken the challenge to achieve Bronze, Silver, or Gold levels of the Award.

Cadets are entitled to wear the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award pin upon successful completion of each level, making it an easy and subtle way of stating a Cadet is above average.
