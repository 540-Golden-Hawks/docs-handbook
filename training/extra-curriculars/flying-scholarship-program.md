# Flying scholarship program

Every year our senior cadets have the opportunity to apply for the Air Cadet Glider Power Pilot Scholarship \(GPS\) or Power Pilot Scholarship \(PPS\) programs. These programs are offered as seven-week intensive training courses over the summer. Successful candidates of the PPS have the opportunity to obtain their Transport Canada Private Pilot’s License.

Running from September through January each year, the Ground School program is provided locally at 540 Sqn to offer academic training to interested cadets who wish to compete for selection in the GPS or PPS programs. Ground School is not an easy course to take and requires extreme dedication, studying, and constant testing. From an academic perspective it is equivalent to a Grade 12 or higher course. To apply for the GPS or PPS scholarships, a cadet must successfully complete Ground School and have the recommendation of the Ground School staff. In order to attend Ground School, cadets must be a minimum of 15 years of age by August 31, and have completed Level 3 in the Cadet Training Program. Cadets interested in the GPS program must be less than 6’3″ tall and weigh less than 200 lbs due to physical restrictions of the gliders.

All Ground School students will be expected to have a copy of “From the Ground Up” \(FGU\). The current version is the 29th version. The ISBN number for the FGU you need is: 978-0-9730036-3-5. Be certain it is the Canadian version, not the American version. They are different! Weekly assignments and exam questions will be sourced from FGU.

Here are some possible Canadian sources, please confirm prices prior to purchase:

* Spectrum Airways \(Burlington Airpark\)
* Waterloo Wellington Flight Centre
