# Algonquin canoe trip

At the end of August, a small group of cadets are chosen to go to Algonquin Park for a 5-6 day canoe trip. Completely detached from civilization and technology \(no electricity or cell phone signal!\), the cadets spend the week canoeing and portaging deep into the park and sleeping in camp sites along the edges of its lakes.

‌Cadets are chosen to attend based on their attendance, attitude, and participation throughout the training year, as well as the results of their written and practical canoe skills evaluation.

‌Cadets are provided all necessary canoe training; previous canoe experience is not a requirement to attend.
