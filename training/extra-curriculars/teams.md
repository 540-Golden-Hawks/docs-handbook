# Teams

Many of our Cadets maintain a high level of activity and engagement with our Squadron by participating in extracurricular teams on evenings and weekends throughout the training year.

Our staff have observed that Cadets who participate on a team are more likely to have greater success with the Cadet Program overall due to building stronger relationships with peers, as well as increased opportunities to develop and practice leadership skills.

Our teams include: 

* Biathlon
* Effective speaking
* Marksmanship
* Military band
* Parliamentary debate
* Precision drill
* Rifle drill
* Sports

Of special note is our military band, which has had the honour of being awarded Top Band in Ontario for 3 years in a row.
