# Promotions

Promotion in rank is merit based and recognizes Cadets for their proficiency within the training program. Cadets are assessed by their Level Officers on the following leadership attributes in addition to the listed promotion criteria. Promotions are not automatically given based on time in rank.

## Leadership attributes

Level Officers take the following leadership attributes into considered when recommending whether or not a Cadet should be promoted:

* Dress and deportment;
* Conduct, discipline, and attitude;
* Participation;
* Response to direction;
* Ability to interact positively and comfortably with others;
* Ability to make sound judgements regarding their own actions;
* Willingness to accept responsibility;
* Ability to solve problems effectively;
* Ability to communicate effectively;
* Ability to set a positive example for others; and
* Initiative.

## Promotion criteria

Promotion to any rank must follow the following three criteria:

* Ensure that all cadets who receive a rank promotion possess the same basic qualifications / similar experience;
* Ensure that merit and the successful completion of sqn training serve as the common standard on which all cadets are evaluated; and
* Ensure that every cadet is given the same opportunity to advance.
