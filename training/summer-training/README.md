# Summer training

## General

Summer Training, also erroneously known as “summer camp” is conducted at one of many Cadet Training Centre \(CTC\) across Ontario and Canada. Summer Training provides cadets with in depth and specialized knowledge to supplement their regular training. Courses run during July and August, and range from 2 to 7 weeks long. Some of the topics offered include aviation, leadership, fitness, marksmanship, survival, music, and more.

Being selected to attend Summer Training is a competitive process and cadets are required to apply and go through a selection process that is based on several factors such as their attendance records, participation in squadron activities, and performance within the squadron. Advanced courses such as the Glider and Power Pilot Scholarships and International Air Cadet Exchange courses require a more extensive application process including an interview with a selection committee comprised of members of the Air Cadet League of Canada and the Department of National Defence.

Cadet summer training courses are broken up into the following categories:

1. Introductory course
2. Basic courses
3. Advanced courses
4. National courses
5. Staff

## Application process

All summer training applicants must:

* Have joined the squadron before 31 Dec
* Have a minimum of 75% attendance for mandatory training activities
* Have completed their tagging shifts and returned their lottery tickets stubs

Cadet that will turn 19 years of age before the course end date are not eligible to apply.

There is no guarantee that the applicant will receive a course offer.

The application form can be found on the Squadron website.

The Upper Canada District School Board \(UCDSB\) offers high school co-op credits for participation in a Cadet Summer Training Course.
