## Advanced Training \(“Staff Cadet”\)

Staff cadets are the NCOs of the Cadet Training Centres. A staff cadet can assist the officer staff with the instruction and supervision of cadets, or might be tasked in an administrative or logistical support role. Rank and pay for staff cadets depend upon the position; this is usually determined during a pre-course training and evaluation period.

Staff Cadets must be 16 years of age by 1 Jan of the training year.
