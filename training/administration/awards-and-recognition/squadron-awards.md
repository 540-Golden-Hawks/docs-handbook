## Medals

### Lord Strathcona Medal

The Lord Strathcona Medal \(LSM\) is the highest Award which can be bestowed upon a Cadet in recognition of exemplary performance in physical and military training.

The Medal and the accompanying Certificate of Merit are awarded by the Lord Strathcona Trust. The issue and wearing of the LSM is authorized by the Chief of the Defence Staff. Each Air Cadet Squadron may award one Medal in each training year, but the award of the Medal is to be based solely on the availability of a worthy candidate. Awarding the LSM annually is not mandatory and should not be a matter of custom for a particular appointment or by seniority alone.
