# 4. Uniform standards

## General

Uniforms are temporarily issued to Cadets at no charge. Uniforms are provided and funded by the Department of National Defence. Cadets are responsible for the care, cleaning and custody of the uniform and also to return it when ceasing to be a Cadet.

The uniform includes:

1. A wedge cap
2. Rank slip-ons
3. Short sleeved shirt
4. Necktie
5. Jacket \(also referred to as a “tunic”\)
6. Jacket belt
7. Trousers
8. Trouser belt
9. All-season jacket
10. Ankle boots
11. Grey wool socks
12. All applicable badges and accoutrements

All Cadets are to write their name in their personal belongings and to ensure they have the correct item when leaving any cadet activity. Name tags will be worn by cadets.

New Cadets shall only be issued a uniform once all enrolment paperwork is complete and signed off by the Commanding Officer \(CO\). A Cadet must have a continued presence at the squadron before receiving a uniform.

A new Cadet is expected to attend training in appropriate civilian clothing as stated above until they have been issued a uniform.

If there is a part of your uniform that no longer fits, or needs to be replaced, see the Supply Officer early in the evening on a training night. You will need to see the Supply Officer with the item that needs to be replaced/exchanged. To help the process go quickly, it is recommended that you know the size of the current item you are exchanging.
