# 2.3 Chain of Command

Each department within the Squadron is operated by a command team partnership between Staff Cadet and Adult Staff.

| Department | Staff Cadet appointment\(s\) | Adult Staff position\(s\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command** | Squadron Warrant Officer \(SWO\) | Commanding Officer \(CO\), Deputy Commanding Officer \(DCO\) |
| **Training** | Training Warrant Officer, Level Warrant Officer, Level Staff| Training Officer \(TrgO\), Assistant Training Officer, Level officer \(LvlO\), Assistant Level Officer|
| **Training Support** | Admin Warrant Officer, Admin Staff, Supply Staff | Admin Officer \(AdmO\), Assistant Admin Officer, Supply Officer \(SupO\), Assistant Supply Officer |
| **Extracurriculars** |  Team Commander | Team Coach |

In addition to the above positions, Staff Cadets take on many other leadership appointments within extracurricular teams and activities, as well as when on the Parade Square.

It is standard operating procedure for military units to operate with a clearly defined Chain of Command. This is beneficial because the Commanding Officer – being only one person – can not realistically meet with each member within the unit individually to address concerns.

The Chain of Command is the command hierarchy within our unit starting at the top with the Commanding Officer, proceeding down to the Adult Staff in the appropriate department, and then down the Cadet ranks. ultimately ending at the bottom with our brand new recruits. The expectation is that Cadets ask questions of their peers or their Staff Cadets before jumping straight to an Adult Staff member.

The Chain of Command is designed to facilitate ease of communication as well as leadership experience in our Staff Cadets. However, there are occasions when it is necessary to bypass the Chain of Command, e.g. due to safety or time constraints, sensitive issues not appropriate for youth to deal with, or other reasons. In these situations it is appropriate and encouraged for Cadets or parents to directly contact an Adult Staff member or directly contact the CO as they see fit.

All our Adult Staff members have an open door policy. In fact, the staff office sits in the main school hallway – so there are no doors.
