# 2.1 Cadet Program

At the highest level, the Cadet Program is a partnership between two separate groups.

## Department of National Defence \(DND\)

The DND provides support for the delivery of the Cadet Program via:

* Creating the program syllabus 
* Providing staff at national, regional, and local levels
* Issuing uniforms
* Funding mandatory training activities

At the local level, the DND is represented by approximately 10 Commissioned Officers in the Canadian Armed Forces attached to 540 Sqn. These Officers are in the Cadet Instructor Cadre branch of the military and are all reservists with either full time day jobs, or are pursuing post-secondary education.

## Air Cadet League of Canada

The Air Cadet League of Canada is a civilian, non-profit, community-based and volunteer-led organization that in collaboration with the Department of National Defence and our other partners, is dedicated to supporting the objectives of the Royal Canadian Air Cadet program. The purposes of the League are to advance the education of the Air Cadets and to promote an interest in the air element of the Canadian Forces, specifically:

1. To increase knowledge of aviation by providing educational programs and resources, including flight and ground crew training, guided visits to science and aviation facilities, and aviation-related awards and scholarships;
2. To encourage the development of citizenship and leadership through enrichment activities such as effective speaking and music, community volunteer opportunities, and academic awards and scholarships; and
3. To provide air cadet training as a means of promoting the efficiency of the armed forces.

At the local level, the League is represented by the “540 Golden Hawks - Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron Sponsor Committee”, a registered charity, made up of parent volunteers and local professionals dedicating their time to the support of the Squadron.
