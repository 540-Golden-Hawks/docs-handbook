# 5.4 Electronic communication & social media

It is expected that Adult Staff and Cadets will engage in electronic communication via email, Google Classroom, Slack, etc. This communication will be conducted professionally and will be of a formal nature. Adult Staff and Cadets are prohibited from engaging in electronic correspondence of a personal nature with each other.

Emails will follow proper etiquette and include salutations, as well as a signature block including rank, name, and position as appropriate. Emails will also be addressed to an appropriate level of the Chain of Command.

The Squadron operates several official social media profiles \(e.g. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook\). It is acceptable for Adult Staff and Cadets to engage with each other via these public means \(e.g. responding to comments on a post\). However, Adult Staff and Cadets are prohibited from engaging beyond this, e.g. being on each other’s “friend/follower” lists.
