# 6.4 Paperwork

## Annual validation form

We validate our Cadets’ contact and medical information at the start of each training year. This is an important form that Cadets must have their parents sign off on in order for them to participate in Cadet activities.

The form is provided in-person and we require parents to come into the school to sign it.

Changes to contact information can be ink-amended on the paper form. Changes to medical information \(e.g. change in medication or allergies\) will need to be validated via a Detailed Health Questionnaire and/or allergy forms.

## Detailed Health Questionnaire \(“DHQ”\)

The DHQ can be found on our website under the [joining instructions](https://540goldenhawks.ca/join).

A DHQ is required for any Cadet that takes medication, has allergies, or has any other medical limitations that may prevent them from fully participating in the Cadet Program.

The Squadron Staff are not medical professionals and are not authorized to read the contents of the DHQ. Having said that, we encourage parents to inform our Staff of any health or medical issues that may be relevant for the success of their Cadet.

If you have any questions, please ask our Admin Staff.

## Anaphylactic allergies

Similar to DHQs, the relevant anaphylactic allergy forms can be found on the website under the [joining instructions](https://540goldenhawks.ca/join).

There are at least three forms that are required. Instructions on which forms are required as well as other requirements are all listed on the website.

## Health card

Cadets must have valid health insurance in order to participate in the Cadet Program.

For Cadets with an Ontario health card, we need to be informed of the new version code and expiry date each time the health card is renewed.
