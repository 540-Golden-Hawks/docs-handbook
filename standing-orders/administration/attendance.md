# 6.2 Attendance

All Cadets must maintain a minimum 70% attendance rate throughout the training year. Staff Cadets are expected to maintain a minimum of 80% attendance. This attendance is calculated based on Tuesday training nights.

Any Cadet who is absent without leave for three or more training nights in a row shall be SOS \(Stuck off Strength\) and recovery action for uniform undertaken.

It is the responsibility of the individual cadet to inform their staff of their reasons for being absent prior to missing any Squadron activities.

Attendance statistics will be a factor in determining promotions, appointments, awards, and participation in extracurricular activities and teams.

## Reporting an absence

Cadets can report an absence from a mandatory training activity by filling in the absence reporting form available on the announcements page of the website.

Absences from other activities such as team practices, competitions, or field trips should be communicated directly to the team as appropriate, using the appropriate method for that specific team.

## Leave of absence

Cadets are encouraged to speak to their Level Warrant and Level Officer if there are any circumstances that would warrant an extended leave of absence. Special accommodations can be made as long as the request is made and the Level Officer is informed of the requirement.
